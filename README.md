# Naruto Infinite List

A small React + TypeScript + Vite application demonstrating an infinite/virtualized list UI pattern. The app is built with modern frontend tooling and aims to be a concise, easy-to-read example of how to implement infinite scrolling, lazy loading, and efficient list rendering in a TypeScript React codebase.

## What this repository contains

- A Vite + React + TypeScript application (primary language: TypeScript).
- Styles (CSS) and a small amount of JavaScript/HTML for the frontend.
- Example implementation of an infinite-scroll list (the project name suggests a Naruto-themed dataset, but the pattern is generic and can be adapted to any paginated data source).

## Features

- Infinite/continuous scrolling to load items as the user scrolls.
- TypeScript-first codebase with typed components and utilities.
- Minimal Vite configuration for fast development and builds.
- Small, focused component structure that demonstrates common patterns:
  - Data fetching and pagination
  - Custom hooks for reuse (e.g., useInfiniteScroll or useFetch)
  - Presentational and container components for clear separation of concerns

## Tech stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS (for styling)
- (Optional) Common helpers: fetch APIs, debounce utilities, simple caching

## Getting started

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (recommend LTS)
- npm or yarn

Common commands:
- Install dependencies
  - npm install
  - or yarn
- Run development server
  - npm run dev
  - or yarn dev
- Build for production
  - npm run build
  - or yarn build
- Preview production build locally
  - npm run preview
  - or yarn preview
- Lint / format (if configured)
  - npm run lint
  - npm run format

(Adjust commands above to match the repository's actual package.json scripts.)

## Code organization (typical)

While exact paths may vary, expect a structure similar to:

- src/
  - main.tsx — app entry point
  - App.tsx — root app / routes
  - components/
    - InfiniteList/ — core list and list item components
    - CharacterCard.tsx — presentational card (if themed)
  - hooks/
    - useInfiniteScroll.ts — intersection observer or scroll listener
    - useFetch.ts — reusable fetch/pagination logic
  - api/
    - clients or adapters for fetching list pages
  - styles/
    - global.css, component css files
  - types/
    - domain and API TypeScript types
  - utils/
    - helpers like debounce, throttle, formatting
- public/ — static assets

This layout keeps presentational components, hooks, API logic, and types separated so the infinite-list behavior is easy to reason about and reuse.

## Implementation notes and suggestions

- Infinite scroll can be implemented with:
  - IntersectionObserver on a sentinel element at the end of the list, or
  - Scroll event + threshold logic (less preferred for performance)
- For large lists, consider virtualization (react-window / react-virtual) to improve rendering performance.
- Add loading and error states for better UX when fetching pages.
- Debounce or throttle scroll/fetch triggers to reduce duplicate requests.
- Use TypeScript types for API responses and component props to increase maintainability.
- Testing: add unit tests for hooks and components (React Testing Library + Vitest / Jest).
